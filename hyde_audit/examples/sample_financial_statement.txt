NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Reporting Entity
The University of Example (the "University") is a public institution of higher education and is a component unit of the State of Example. The University is governed by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Governor of the State of Example.

Financial Statement Presentation
The University's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).

Basis of Accounting
For financial reporting purposes, the University is considered a special-purpose government engaged only in business-type activities. Accordingly, the University's financial statements have been presented using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis, revenues are recognized when earned, and expenses are recorded when an obligation has been incurred.

Cash Equivalents
The University considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Investments
Investments are reported at fair value in accordance with GASB Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurement and Application.

Capital Assets
Capital assets are recorded at cost at the date of acquisition, or acquisition value at the date of donation in the case of gifts. For equipment, the University's capitalization policy includes all items with a unit cost of $5,000 or more and an estimated useful life of greater than one year. Renovations to buildings and land improvements that significantly increase the value or extend the useful life of the structure are capitalized. Routine repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense in the year in which the expense is incurred.

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets:
- Buildings: 40 years
- Infrastructure and land improvements: 20 years
- Equipment: 5 to 15 years
- Library materials: 10 years

Note 2 - Compliance with GASB Standards

The University has implemented all applicable GASB pronouncements, including GASB Statement No. 84, Fiduciary Activities, and GASB Statement No. 87, Leases, as of June 30, 2023.

Note 3 - Single Audit Compliance

The University has undergone a Single Audit in accordance with the Uniform Guidance. The Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards and related notes are available under separate cover. There were no material weaknesses or significant deficiencies identified in the Single Audit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.
